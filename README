Introduction
============

	This is the Java library providing interop capability with the SOA feature
	on Windows HPC cluster.

	All the source code reside in src\ folder. Samples are put under samples\.
	
Prerequisites
=============

    1) JDK 1.6.0.23
       Please follow JDK's instructions on how to install.
       
    2) CXF 2.4.0 (Warning: other versions of CXF may not work.)
       Download apache-cxf-2.4.0.zip to home directory. unzip it there.

How to build
============

	Assuming you are on Linux,

	1) On client machine download and install all "Prerequisites".
	
	2) Switch to src\ directory and edit makejar.sh 
	   ( makejar.cmd if you are one Windows ).
	
	3) Make sure CXF_HOME points to the correct location.
	   E.g., "export CXF_HOME=~/apache-cxf-2.4.0".
	   
	4) Run "makejar.sh" without any argument.

How to setup the system
=======================
	On both head node and broker node, setup certificate. 
	(NOTE: if your broker node is your head node, only do it for once.)
	
	a) make sure makecert.exe is in your PATH.
	
		NOTE: you might need to install Windows SDK to get makecert.exe.
		Or install Visual Studio 2010 to get Windows SDK.

	b) Create a self-signed certificate. Run the following command in 
	   elevated console:
	   
		createcert.cmd <nodename>
		
	   Createcert.cmd can be found under ~\tools\ directory.
		
	c) Install the certificate. In PowerShell, run as an admin user,
	
		- Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
		- installcert.ps1 install
		- select the new certificate just created above. It's the one named 
		  "CN=<nodename>". Normally it should be the last one.


	On java client (Linux) machine, set up SSL trust between Java client and Headnode/BrokerNode.
            
         - Create the environment variable JAVA_HOME and set it to the Java installation path. Compile the GetCert.java under ~/tools/

                    - "$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac" GetCert.java

         a) Create head node and broker node certificates.
            - "$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" GetCert <HeadNode>
            - The above should create a file called "cacerts_new"
            - If broker node is a different node, call "$JAVA_HOME/bin/java" GetCert <BrokerNode>
            - The above should update the file "cacerts_new" with the certificate for broker node
            - copy ecacerts to overwrite $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts (NOTE: You need administrate privilege on Vista/7)

	Please note the above step on linux client is only required when the preference file ~/.java/.userPrefs/com/microsoft/hpc/scheduler/session/prefs.xml exists and contains the following entry:
	<map MAP_XML_VERSION="1.0">
	  <entry key="RequireSSLValidation" value="true"/>
	</map>

	If the preference file does not exist or the value is "false" for the key "RequireSSLValidation", the certificates are not required.

	
How to use
==========

	Refer to sample\helloworld\README.Linux.txt for how to use this library.

How to get WSDL
===============

	Normally, WSDL is not needed since the Java Session API has already been
	created. However, if you wish to develope your own client (e.g., a python
	API), you need to configure the cluster to expose WSDL correctly. 
	
	To do this, on head node, edit %CCP_HOME%Bin\HpcSession.exe.config. Replace 
	"localhost:443" with your <headnode>:443.

	For example, assume your headnode is called "HeadNode1"
   
	<services>
		<service name="Microsoft.Hpc.Scheduler.Session.Internal.SessionLauncher.SessionLauncher" behaviorConfiguration="EnableMetadata">
			<host>
				<baseAddresses>
					<add baseAddress="https://HeadNode1:443/SessionLauncher"/>
				</baseAddresses>
			</host>
			...
	</service>
