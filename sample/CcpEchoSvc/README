Introduction

    This will create a CcpEchoSvc.jar for using Java based CcpEchoSvc service.

    

Prerequisites:
    JDK & Apache CXF installation on compute nodes
    - JDK. The version we support is 1.6.0_23.
      After installation, set environment variable JAVA_HOME to the home directory of JDK. Add JRE\bin to path variable.
	
    - Apache CXF. The version we support is 2.4.0.
      After installation(c:\java\apache-cxf-2.4.0), set environment variable CXF_HOME to the home directory of Apache CXF.

How to create Java Session API and Java Service Host jar files:
    - Open the JAVA-INTEROP-LIBRARY/src folder.

    - Open manifestclient and manifesthost, replace %CXF_HOME% with home directory of Apache CXF(c:\java\apache-cxf-2.4.0), then save and exit.

    - Double-click makejar.cmd. 
      After completion, two files named Microsoft-HpcSession-3.0.jar and Microsoft-HpcServiceHost-3.0.jar will appear.

    - Copy these two .jar files to %CCP_HOME%\bin on each compute node.

How to create the jar
    - Open Java-Interop-Library/sample/CcpEchoSvc
    - Copy Microsoft-HpcSession-3.0.jar to the current folder
    - Replace replace %CXF_HOME% with home directory of Apache CXF(c:\java\apache-cxf-2.4.0), then save and exit.
    - Run: makejar.cmd


Service deployment:
    - Copy the following files to C:\JavaSvcHostTest\ on each Compute Node.

        JavaEchoSvc.jar
        EchoSvcLib.xsd
        tempuri.org.wsdl
        schemas.microsoft.com.2003.10.Serialization.xsd
        tempuri.org.xsd
        
    - Copy JavaEchoSvc.config to the service registrion directory(%CCP_HOME%\ServiceRegistration) on head node.

Consume the sample service using sample client:
    - Go to ..\helloworld folder
    - Refer to the README file and run the java sample client
